      "I am Syed Siddiq based in Dubai, UAE. I am looking for a Professional Web Designer & Developer who has a company, so that we collaborate and work as partners. I have good client base here in Dubai and had staff who were working with me but as you know the cost of leaving is v high here, so could not afford them  and they left me after getting good jobs. Right now working with freelancers who are not delivering me on time & at times making clients unhappy.  I want to work with you & will give you work and in return you have to give me at best rates. I am giving websites at afforable price & still want to reduce cost & give best services. Waiting for your reply.\n",
